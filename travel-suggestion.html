    <p>
      Frankfurt, officially known as Frankfurt am Main (German: "Frankfurt am Main"; lit. "Frank ford on the Main"), stands as the vibrant heart of the German state of Hesse. With a populace of 791,000 as of 2022, it ranks as the fifth-most populous city in Germany, and holds the prestigious title of an "alpha world city" by GaWC, a distinction unique in the nation. Nestled in the foreland of the Taunus on the banks of the Main River, it seamlessly merges with its neighboring city, Offenbach am Main, forming a bustling conurbation with an urban population exceeding 2.3 million. Frankfurt serves as the nucleus of the expansive Rhine-Main metropolitan region, boasting a populace surpassing 5.8 million and standing as Germany's second-largest metropolitan area, trailing only the Rhine-Ruhr region. Moreover, it ranks as the fourth-largest metropolitan region by GDP within the European Union.

At its core, Frankfurt hosts the European Central Bank, a pivotal institution within the European Union. Interestingly, the city's central business district lies approximately 90 km northwest of the geographical center of the EU, situated in Gadheim, Lower Franconia. Reflecting its historical roots, Frankfurt derives its name from the Franks, akin to the appellations of France and Franconia. It serves as the principal city within the Rhenish Franconian dialect zone.

    <p>
      The term in its wider sense refers to that part of the Eastern Alps that lies on Bavarian state territory. However, it is traditionally understood that the Bavarian Alps are only those ranges between the rivers Lech and Saalach (Altbayern). In this narrower sense, the Allgäu Alps in Swabia, which have only been part of Bavaria in more recent times, and the Berchtesgaden Alps in the east are not considered part of the Bavarian Alps.

The term is frequently used, but does not correspond to the common classification of the Eastern Alps (AVE) developed by the German, Austrian and South Tyrol Alpine Clubs. It should not be confused with the term Bavarian Prealps either. The latter only covers the Bavarian section of the Prealps between the River Loisach in the west and the River Inn in the east.

According to the Italian Partizione Delle Alpi classification, the Bavarian Alps (Alpi Bavaresi) comprise the Allgäu and Lechtal Alps as well as the adjacent Achen Lake mountains.
