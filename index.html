      <span class="first-letter">I</span> Avant-garde: A word that aptly defines Zurich for its arts and literary works; it’s the birthplace to Dada, it’s the origin of the innovative Freitag bags, and a place which brought into existence the designers' much-loved typeface, Helvetica.
Zurich is home to many leading companies who introduce cutting-edge innovation to the world. Some of them are the world’s widely used search engine – Google, the creator of the world’s happiest theme parks – Disney, and even the acclaimed Swiss Federal Institue of Technology (ETH).
